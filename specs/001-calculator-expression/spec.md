# Calculator Expression Specification

## Feature Description
This feature provides functionality to parse, validate, and evaluate mathematical expressions, returning a numerical result.

## Input
A string representing a mathematical expression (e.g., "2 + 3 * (4 / 2)").

## Output
A numerical result of the evaluated expression.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system must correctly evaluate basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- The system must handle operator precedence.
- The system must support parentheses for grouping operations.
- The system must validate the input expression for syntax errors (e.g., unmatched parentheses, invalid characters).
- The system must handle division by zero gracefully.
