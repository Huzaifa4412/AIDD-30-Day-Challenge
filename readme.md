# AI Driven Development

- We Asked AI to create Some thing like to create a website with frontend and backend and AI did it for us.

- We plan and instruct AI to perform Task AI writes code, debugs if needed, build test UNITS, etc. You just have to instruct AI to do the task. and Allow or Reject the request of the AI. Basically you are the boss of the AI. And In this Case AI just create an Static code means After deploy there is no more interaction between AI and the code.

- AI can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple websites to complex software systems. It can also be used to automate tasks, analyze data, and provide recommendations. AI can be used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing.

- Mostly the control is in our's Hand

# AI Native Development

- AI can be used to create applications that are specifically designed to work with AI technologies. This can include applications that use machine learning algorithms to analyze data, natural language processing to understand and respond to user input, or other AI technologies to improve the functionality of the application.

- Here we use AI to create AI applications that can learn, Interact with other AI and can be used to create AI applications. In this case AI learns from it's Past experience and improve it's performance.

- In this case the control of flow is in AI's hand. not human. It's Automatically fix, changes , remove whatever AI want. Totally on it's hand

# The Three Laws of Co-Learning

### Teach the AI through clarity

- The clearer your specification, the smarter your agent becomes
Ambiguity creates confusion for both human and AI
Let the AI teach you through reflection

- Every piece of AI-generated code is a lesson in reasoning
Don't just copy — analyze why it chose that structure
Learn patterns you didn't know existed
Evolve together

- Each iteration improves both you and the AI
You get better at spec-writing; the AI improves its generation
Convergence happens through practice, not perfection
